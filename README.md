1. Introduction and Theoretical Background
The RFID-based Attendance System is a modern solution designed to streamline and automate the attendance tracking process in various settings such as classrooms, offices, or any environment requiring accurate attendance records. Leveraging Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, this system offers a robust and efficient method for identifying individuals and recording their attendance seamlessly.
This project is driven by the need for a reliable and automated attendance management system that eliminates manual data entry, reduces errors, and enhances the overall efficiency of attendance tracking. The utilization of RFID technology ensures quick and non-intrusive identification, making it an ideal solution for large groups of individuals.
The methodology encompasses several key phases, starting with the definition of system requirements and the selection of appropriate hardware components, including the NodeMCU (ESP8266) microcontroller and the MFRC522 RFID module. The system's architecture is carefully designed to facilitate the flow of data between the RFID module, NodeMCU, and a server, ensuring a seamless and secure communication process.
Hardware setup involves connecting the RFID module and an LED indicator to the NodeMCU, adhering to specified hardware specifications and pin configurations. Adequate power supply considerations are addressed to ensure the stable operation of all components.
The software development phase entails writing firmware for the NodeMCU using the Arduino IDE. Functions are implemented to initialize the RFID module, establish a Wi-Fi connection, and manage communication with the server. Additional functionalities include reading RFID card information and transmitting it to the server, along with error-handling mechanisms to ensure stable operation.
On the server side, a dedicated system is set up to handle HTTP requests from the NodeMCU. A database is created to store RFID card information and attendance records. Server-side scripts, developed using PHP or other server-side languages, process incoming data, update the database, and respond to the NodeMCU with relevant information.
Testing is conducted at both the individual component level and through integration to verify proper functionality. Simulated RFID card events are used to assess the system's response, ensuring accuracy and reliability in real-world scenarios.
Upon successful testing, the system is deployed in the target environment, be it a classroom or office. Stability and reliability are continuously monitored, with implemented mechanisms for addressing any issues that may arise during operation. A comprehensive documentation process covers system architecture, hardware connections, software code, and user manuals to provide a reference for future maintenance and improvements.
